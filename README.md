# MyInfocom
All my Infocom discoveries and learning... CPM, Zork and beyond!


## What Do We Have Here Then?
I am interested in CPM, Infocom and, of-course, Zork!

Zork, and all the Infocom gaves consist of an interpreter and a game data file. The interpreters understand Z-Code, and the game files are some version of Z-Code.

So far I have worked only with an interpreter that definitely understands Z-Code v3 (z3) game files.

And before I forget, I have snagged everything from here:

## What Have I Done?
Not much, but it has been interesting and fun, and all with runCPM v6.7 (64bit) on Windows 10!

* I have taken the CPM Z80 Z-Code interperter and successfully assembled it with Z80ASM.
* Fixed a few issues with the Z80 code to allow a clean assemble.
* Got the Z-Code interpreter working with a Zork1 (common R88 z3) data file.
* Fixed some text display issues changing some Wyse terminal codes for ANSI control codes.
* Worked through the entire assembly file standardising the formating and layout (to my liking).


## What's Next?
* More examination of the CPM Z80 Z-Code interpreter code.
* Try the assembled Zork1 code on my RC2040.
* Re-assemble the CPM Z80 Z-Code interpreter code for Zork 2, 3 and more.

The text editor TE is just excellent.

The Z80 assembler Z80ASM is fantastic.
